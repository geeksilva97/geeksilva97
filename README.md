### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edy Silva. I'm a software engineer who loves to experiment with different tools to discover their full potential. I'm also a learning aficionado, and I enjoy recreating existing tools just to understand how they work internally. To document my discoveries and thoughts, I write them in blog posts.

### Open source contributions

Open source is another way to explore different scenarios where I could make contributions in JavaScript, Ruby, Elixir, and Erlang. Since last year, I have focused my efforts on the [Node.Js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project, where I am now a core collaborator. In Node.JS I could work on a variety of issues where I can highlight two main cases:

#### Fix AbortSignal memory leak

#### SQLite backup implementation
